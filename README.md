# Morocco-Reading-Habit
This project delves into the multitasking behaviors of 700 Moroccan EFL teachers, focusing on how their academic and recreational reading habits are influenced by various background factors. Using an online time-diary survey, the study examines the impact of multitasking activities, such as Internet browsing and television viewing, on teachers' reading time. The findings indicate significant variations in multitasking based on age, gender, teaching experience, availability of devices, time of day, school type, and teaching level. For instance, teachers from rural schools reported less multitasking compared to those from suburban and urban areas, and differences were also observed between male and female teachers. Additionally, the availability of digital devices and the time of day significantly affected the extent of multitasking. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of how different factors contribute to multitasking behaviors among teachers, offering valuable implications for designing interventions to enhance focused reading practices in educational settings.
